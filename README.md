This is a discord bot which is meant to do whatever you want.
It can ask ai a question for you, flip a coin, and do many more things.
Currently this is still under development, and only has two added on functions apart from the template.
These are ask ai, and movie_titles.

AskAI:
it does whats in the name, and asks deepseek-r1 for a response to the users question. Since the api is free, it does take time for a response and at times will take too long.

MovieTitles:
This command works consistently and will list all the movie titles in the ml-100k dataset in a pagination.

Recommend:
This function relies on deepseek-r1 as well, and as a result doesn't work consistently.

earn.py
inside earn.py, the work, crime, and gamble functions dont work, but you can use the profile and register function consistently
